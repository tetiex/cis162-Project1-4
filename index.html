    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>I am Ananta Raj Malla, pursuing Computer Science major in <a href="https://www.cerritos.edu">Cerritos College</a>. I want to pursue my career in front-end designing. To achieve my goals I need to transfer in university so that I can adapt and learn more skills and knowledge. I am really excited about this class, as I have recently opened restaurant, and I wanted to handle a website for my restaurant. Hope, in the end of this class, I would learn, pass and apply in a practical world, as it will help me to build my skills and knowledge.</p>
    <p>I have a restaurant business "<a href="https://www.indiagrill-lagunaniguel.com/">India Grill</a>", partnering with my close friends, I work as a part-time server in my own restaurant. My friend is a chef and work as a 'Active Partner' and manager in <strong>India Grill</strong>.</p>

    <h3>When I have free time</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Watch a lot of videos on youtube.</li>
        <li>Play guitar, piano, flute and drums.</li>
        <li>Interact with new technologies.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>My favorite web site is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a> because I keep watching videos of new techs, i/os and sometimes coding referrals.
